Example iOS project showing how Auto-Layout can calculate the contentSize of a UIScrollView for you based on the constraints of the scroll viewâ€™s subviews.

This example is based on [this tutorial](http://www.apeth.com/iOSBook/ch20.html), which uses Auto-Layout directly with Apple's [Visual Layout Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/formatLanguage.html).

## USAGE

This project uses the iOS Masonry library to manage the Auto-Layout constraints. Before running the project, run the following:

`pod install`
